# Modern Kwizzer

A modern rewrite of the classic Kwizzer app, now featuring a sleek UI, smooth animations, and TypeScript support. This version represents a complete modernization of the [original Kwizzer](https://github.com/MrRyanAlexander/Kwizzer) project, rebuilt from the ground up using current best practices and modern web technologies.

## About

Kwizzer was originally built using Parse as its backend service. After Parse was acquired by Facebook and subsequently shut down (with the core being open-sourced), the original version became outdated. This new version has been completely refactored using [Bolt.new](https://bolt.new), embracing modern web development practices and technologies.

- ðŸ“± Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices
- âš¡ Immediate feedback on answers
